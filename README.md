# 2-Power-BI-Sales-Insights
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
**Project Overview**

AtliQ Hardware supplies hardwares to many clients across India. The sales director is facing challenges in tracking sales and he was not getting a complete picture of the sales happening within the country. He is interested in a dashboard through which he can track the sales to get up to date info. Thus, making data driven decisions to increase sales of the company.

I have implemented a Power BI dashboard to get the sales insights.
